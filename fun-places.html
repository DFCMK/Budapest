                <h2>Szimpla Kert</h2><br>
            <p>Szimpla Kert is a ruin bar or romkocsma, which means "Simple Garden" in Hungarian, located in the Jewish Quarter of the 7th district of Budapest, Hungary.
                It is considered the pioneer of ruin bars.
                The pub started as a place for people to find a cheap drink in a relaxed environment, but has grown to become a tourist attraction and community center.
                Movie showings, live music performances, an art gallery, the Kazinczy Living Library, the Szimpla Farmers' Market, and the Szimpla Bringa bicycle flea market are just a few of the community activities that are held at the bar.[4]

                <br>
                Szimpla Kert is the first ruin pub to open in Budapest, Hungary.
                The Szimpla Kert originally opened in 2002 in a location a few blocks away from its current location.
                The idea behind the pub was to provide a relaxing environment to socialize and have a drink.
                In 2004, a dilapidated area located at 14 Kazinczy Street that used to be homes and a stove factory was set to be demolished.
                The four owners of the Szimpla Kert decided to save the area from demolition and move the pub to this location.
                The group of owners made this decision because the structure provided more space and the environment they were looking for.
                The new location opened as Szimpla Kertmozi (kertmozi translating to open-air cinema in Hungarian) because of the large courtyard on the premises that was used to watch underground and indie films.</p>

            <h2>Parliament</h2><br>
                <p>Budapest was united from three cities in 1873, namely Buda, Óbuda, and Pest. Seven years later the Diet resolved to establish a new, representative parliament building, expressing the sovereignty of the nation.
                The building was planned to face the Danube River. An international competition was held, and Imre Steindl emerged as the victor; the plans of two other competitors were later also realized in the form of the Ethnographic Museum and the Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture, both facing the Parliament Building.
                One reason that Steindl's proposal was chosen is that his neo-Gothic plans bore a strong resemblance with the Palace of Westminster in London.
                Leading Hungarian politicians of the 19th century found it extremely important that the country's new parliament building should symbolise their commitment to Western Europe, especially Britain, the country Hungarian reformers considered a political role model. Construction from the winning plan was started in 1885, and the building was inaugurated on the presumed 1,000th anniversary of the country in 1896.
                The keys to the building being handed over in 1902, however, It was not fully completed until 1904. The architect of the building first went blind and then later, died before its completion.
                About 100,000 people were involved in its construction, during which 40 million bricks, half a million precious stones and 40 kg of gold were used. Since World War II the legislature became unicameral, and today the government uses only a small portion of the building.
                During the People's Republic of Hungary a red star perched on the top of the dome, but it was removed in 1990 after the fall of communism.
                Mátyás Szűrös declared the Hungarian Republic from the balcony facing Kossuth Lajos Square on 23 October 1989.</p>
                
                The Parliament Building is built in the Gothic Revival style; it has a symmetrical façade and a central dome.
                The dome is Renaissance Revival architecture. The parliament is also largely symmetrical from the inside, with two identical parliament halls on the opposing sides of the building.
                One of the two halls is still in use today for sessions of the Hungarian National Assembly, the other for ceremonies, conferences, and guided tours.
                It is 268 m long and 123 m wide.</p>

            <h2>Mátyás-templom</h2><br>
            <p>The Matthias Church, also known as the Church of the Assumption of the Buda Castle, is a Roman Catholic church located in Budapest, Hungary. Its history is quite remarkable.

                Originally, it was believed to have been constructed in Romanesque style in 1015, although there is limited evidence to support this claim. The current building, with its distinctive late Gothic style, was erected in the 14th century and underwent significant restoration work during the 19th century.
                
                Throughout its existence, the Matthias Church played a central role in Hungarian history. It stood as one of the largest churches in medieval Buda and witnessed several pivotal moments. Notably, it served as the site for the coronations of two Hungarian kings, Franz Joseph I and Charles IV.
                
                One of the church's most famous incidents is the "Marian Miracle" of Buda, which occurred during a siege. A hidden Madonna statue was revealed, significantly impacting the morale of those within the city.
                
                The church endured various transformations over the centuries, including a period when it was converted into a mosque during the Turkish occupation. However, in the 19th century, a substantial reconstruction effort, led by architect Frigyes Schulek, aimed to restore its original appearance.
                
                The Matthias Church holds a prominent place in Hungarian culture and identity. It has witnessed royal weddings, coronations, and numerous historical events. Its historical and architectural significance continues to draw visitors and pilgrims from around the world, making it an enduring symbol of Hungary's rich cultural and religious heritage.
