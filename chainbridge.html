            <h2>Chainbridge</h2><br>
            <p>The Széchenyi Chain Bridge is a chain bridge that spans the River Danube between Buda and Pest, the western and eastern sides of Budapest, the capital of Hungary. 
                Designed by English engineer William Tierney Clark and built by Scottish engineer Adam Clark, it was the first permanent bridge across the Danube in Hungary. It was opened in 1849.
                It is anchored on the Pest side of the river to Széchenyi Square, adjacent to the Gresham Palace and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and on the Buda side to Adam Clark Square, near the Zero Kilometre Stone and the lower end of the Castle Hill Funicular, leading to Buda Castle. The bridge has the name of István Széchenyi, a major supporter of its construction, attached to it, but is most commonly known as the "Chain Bridge". At the time of its construction, it was regarded as one of the modern world's engineering wonders. Its decorations are made of cast iron.
                The Chain Bridge was completed between 1839 - 1849.<!--End of Wiki, need adjustment with rest of the article-->
                In this article we look at the conditions in Budapest from 1830 to 1849 to get a better understanding of the importance of the Chain Bridge. 
                The politician Istvan Szechenyi named in his book Hitel three problems for the economic backwardness of Hungary during the Industrial Revolution: tax exemption of the nobility, non-saleability of land and the disenfranchisement of the peasant (peasants were serfs of the nobility). 
                Szecheny was strongly influenced by the Industrial Revolution that had already taken place in England, and as a young man he smuggled a steam engine from England to Hungary. The above mentioned points, which he mentioned in his book "Htiel", slowed down the Hungarian economy and made investments very difficult, for example to have money for the purchase of steam engines to make agriculture efficient. The non-saleability of the land meant that banks, when granting loans, could not rely on any collateral other than the willingness of the peasants to repay the loan.
                Szecsenyi also publicly discussed his ideas in the Diet, financed undertakings such as the Academy of Sciences, and launched some initiatives such as the <b>construction of the Chain Bridge between Buda and Pest.</b>
                    A big problem of the Hungarian economy was that there were large flooded areas. The land there was of course used for agriculture, but this use was greatly hindered by the fact that it was flooded again and again. In order to control the floods, Szechenyi had the rivers Tisza and Danube regulated.
                    However, he had a second problem, the many shallow places made it impossible to use the waterways for transportation by navigation. The riverbed had to be dug out to allow continuous navigation. 
                    A big project was the Chain Bridge, which was built in the 1840s.
                    The significance of this was that transportation became easier.
                    Temporary bridges had to be built beforehand for people and also for the transport of goods across the Danube, which were fragile and not particularly strong, but it was also a symbolic matter.
                    Firstly, that a bridge was built and secondly, that the conditions of use were the same for everyone.
                    Everyone had to pay bridge fees to get across, including the nobles. So no distinction was made between the farmers, the foreigners and the aristocrats.
                    Everyone had to pay this bridge fee, which was a democratic act and therefore also had a symbolic meaning. These reforms meant a direct attack on the existing model of rule and incurred the wrath of the nobility.
                    The Chain Bridge and another infrastructure project, the expansion of a 50 km long railway line between Pest and Vac, were key factors that led to the outbreak of the revolution in 1848/49. At the same time, the completion of the Chain Bridge marked the birth of the city of Buda-Pest, as it connected the two cities of Buda and Pest for the first time.
