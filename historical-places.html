            <h2>Chainbridge</h2><br>
            <p>In this article, we examine the conditions in Budapest from 1830 to 1849 to gain a better understanding of the significance of the Chain Bridge. The politician István Széchenyi, named in his book "Hitel," identified three problems contributing to Hungary's economic backwardness during the Industrial Revolution: tax exemptions for the nobility, the non-saleability of land, and the disenfranchisement of the peasants (who were serfs of the nobility). Széchenyi was greatly influenced by the Industrial Revolution that had already occurred in England, and as a young man, he even smuggled a steam engine from England to Hungary. The issues he mentioned in his book "Hitel" impeded the Hungarian economy, making it challenging to secure investments, such as funds for purchasing steam engines to enhance agriculture.

                The non-saleability of the land meant that banks, when granting loans, couldn't rely on any collateral besides the peasants' willingness to repay the loan. Széchenyi publicly discussed his ideas in the Diet, funded initiatives like the Academy of Sciences, and initiated projects like the construction of the Chain Bridge connecting Buda and Pest.
                
                A significant problem in the Hungarian economy was the presence of large flooded areas, hindering efficient agriculture. To control the floods, Széchenyi undertook the regulation of the rivers Tisza and Danube. Additionally, many shallow areas in the rivers prevented navigation. Dredging the riverbed became necessary to enable continuous navigation. One major project was the construction of the Chain Bridge in the 1840s, which greatly facilitated transportation. Temporary bridges had been required previously for people and goods to cross the Danube, but these were fragile. The Chain Bridge represented not only the construction of a physical bridge but also the establishment of equal conditions for everyone. Bridge fees were imposed on all, including the nobles, which was a democratic and symbolic act.
                
                These reforms directly challenged the existing ruling model and angered the nobility. The completion of the Chain Bridge, along with another infrastructure project - the expansion of a 50 km railway line between Pest and Vac - played pivotal roles in sparking the revolution of 1848/49. Simultaneously, the Chain Bridge's completion marked the birth of the unified city of Buda-Pest, as it connected the previously separate cities of Buda and Pest for the first time.</p>

            <h2>Parliament</h2><br>
                <p>The Hungarian Parliament Building, also called the Parliament of Budapest, stands as a remarkable landmark and tourist attraction in Budapest. Situated on Kossuth Square in the Pest district along the Danube's eastern bank, this neo-Gothic masterpiece was designed by architect Imre Steindl and opened its doors in 1902, becoming Hungary's largest building.

                    Historically, Budapest was formed by merging Buda, Óbuda, and Pest in 1873, leading to the decision to construct a grand parliament building to symbolize national sovereignty. Construction began in 1885 based on Steindl's winning design, and the building was inaugurated in 1896, commemorating Hungary's millennium. The project involved around 100,000 people and used 40 million bricks, half a million precious stones, and 40 kg (88 lb) of gold.
                    
                    Today, the building serves as the National Assembly of Hungary, and while it once hosted a bicameral legislature, it's now unicameral. Notable features include a symmetrical façade, a central dome, and two identical parliament halls—one for sessions and the other for events and tours. With its impressive dimensions of 268 m (879 ft) in length and 123 m (404 ft) in width, it was one of Budapest's tallest structures, symbolizing Hungary's millennium in 1896 and the 896 conquest.
                    
                    The façade is adorned with statues of Hungarian rulers, Transylvanian leaders, and military figures. Inside, visitors are greeted by ornate stairs, ceiling frescoes, and a bust of the architect, Imre Steindl. Notable statues include those of Árpád, Stephen I, and John Hunyadi. The building also showcases stained glass and glass mosaics by Miksa Róth.
                    
                    A highlight is the hexadecagonal (sixteen-sided) central hall, flanked by chambers like the Lower House and the Upper House. Since 2000, the Holy Crown of Hungary has been on display in the central hall. Due to its size and intricate details, the building often undergoes renovation.
                    
                    The Parliament Building is easily accessible via Budapest Metro Line 2 and tram line 2. Nearby, you can find memorials such as the 1956 Hungarian Revolution monument, the Kossuth Memorial, and the equestrian statue of Francis II Rákóczi. Adjacent is Martyrs' Square (Vértanúk tere), featuring a statue of Imre Nagy.</p>

            <h2>Castle</h2><br>
            <p>Buda Castle, or Budavári Palota, in Budapest is a historic palace complex originally constructed in 1265. The Baroque-style palace we see today was built from 1749 to 1769 and has been known as both the Royal Palace (Királyi-palota) and the Royal Castle (Királyi Vár). It's located on Castle Hill in the Castle Quarter (Várnegyed), famous for its diverse architectural styles.

                Throughout its history, the palace underwent significant expansions and renovations, with highlights including:
                
                    Medieval Period: King Béla IV built the first royal residence in the mid-13th century.
                
                    Gothic and Renaissance Periods: King Sigismund and King Matthias Corvinus expanded and enhanced the palace, making it a prominent Gothic and Renaissance structure.
                
                    Ottoman Era: During the Ottoman occupation, the palace fell into disrepair and was damaged.
                
                    Reconstruction: In the 18th century, the palace was reconstructed in Baroque style, later housing the Hungarian National Gallery and the Budapest Historical Museum.
                
                    Modern Era: Extensive reconstruction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries added Neoclassical and Jugendstil elements. The palace was officially inaugurated in 1912.
                
                Today, Buda Castle represents Hungary's rich history and cultural heritage, attracting visitors with its architectural beauty and the treasures it holds.</p>

            <h2>Mátyás-templom</h2><br>
            <p>The Matthias Church, also known as the Church of the Assumption of the Buda Castle, is a Roman Catholic church located in Budapest, Hungary. Its history is quite remarkable.

                Originally, it was believed to have been constructed in Romanesque style in 1015, although there is limited evidence to support this claim. The current building, with its distinctive late Gothic style, was erected in the 14th century and underwent significant restoration work during the 19th century.
                
                Throughout its existence, the Matthias Church played a central role in Hungarian history. It stood as one of the largest churches in medieval Buda and witnessed several pivotal moments. Notably, it served as the site for the coronations of two Hungarian kings, Franz Joseph I and Charles IV.
                
                One of the church's most famous incidents is the "Marian Miracle" of Buda, which occurred during a siege. A hidden Madonna statue was revealed, significantly impacting the morale of those within the city.
                
                The church endured various transformations over the centuries, including a period when it was converted into a mosque during the Turkish occupation. However, in the 19th century, a substantial reconstruction effort, led by architect Frigyes Schulek, aimed to restore its original appearance.
                
                The Matthias Church holds a prominent place in Hungarian culture and identity. It has witnessed royal weddings, coronations, and numerous historical events. Its historical and architectural significance continues to draw visitors and pilgrims from around the world, making it an enduring symbol of Hungary's rich cultural and religious heritage.
