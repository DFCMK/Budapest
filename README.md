Budapest - A Historical Travel Guide have five pages. The [Home](#home) page is the default loading page, [Historical Places](#historical-places), [Fun Places](#fun-places), [Gallery](#gallery) and [Contact](#contact) pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu.

### Design Choices

- [Typography](#typography)

I have choosen the font Lato for the Website because it is supposed to be a travel guide which provide mostly information about Budapest. I felt like other fonts could might be to distracting while reading the Text section on the page.
On the [Home](#home) the welcome Text which appears when the User Hover over the middle on a Laptop or Desktop is in italic to transmit a warm welcome feeling to the Page. The headings of the introduction Section underneth the Background image on the [Home](#home) are in italic to accentuate them from the Text sections below.

- Color Scheme

The color scheme choosen is one based on Monochromatic color Schemes, see blow in the screenshot.
