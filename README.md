## User Experience UX

### Wireframes

The wireframes for Budapest - A Historical Travel Guide were produced in [Balsamiq]("https://balsamiq.cloud/"). There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

### Design Choices

- [Typography](#typography)

I have choosen the font Lato for the Website because it is supposed to be a travel guide which provide mostly information about Budapest. I felt like other fonts could might be to distracting while reading the Text section on the page.
On the [Home](#home) the welcome Text which appears when the User Hover over the middle on a Laptop or Desktop is in italic to transmit a warm welcome feeling to the Page. The headings of the introduction Section underneth the Background image on the [Home](#home) are in italic to accentuate them from the Text sections below.

- Color Scheme

The color scheme choosen is one based on Monochromatic color Schemes, see blow in the screenshot.
